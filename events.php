			<h1>Upcoming Events</h1>

			<h2>Toronto Regionals</h2>

			<h4>
				This is the first stage of competition. You'll be writing an online multiple choice exam, and doing your case study/role
				play in-person. Competitors at this event are mostly from the TDSB.

			<h2>Ontario Provincials</h2>

			<h4>
				Those who score above a cutoff at regionals will qualify for provincials. At this stage of competition, you will be competing
				against all qualifiers from all regionals in Ontario. Being one of the largest DECA provinces/states in the world, the
				calibre of our provincials is often compared to that of ICDC.

			<h2>ICDC</h2>

			<h4>
				Known as the highest level of competition, the International Career Development Conference (ICDC) is where the cream of the
				crop go to compete against the world. If you place high enough in your event at Provincials (historically top 7 though
				this number is known to increase as DECA Ontario grows), you will qualify for a plane ticket to Orlando, Atlanta, Nashville,
				or Anaheim depending on the four-year location cycle. If granted the opportunity, you will not want to miss ICDC. The
				people you meet, pin trading, visits to Disneyland, and the feeling of lifting glass trophies all add up to an experience
				you won't find anywhere else.
